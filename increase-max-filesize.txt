Depending of your php configuration, the biggest size that can be uploaded may be small.

To be able to upload biggest files, you may change some of these parameters.


#   Edit php.ini located 

#   Initial values for my config
      memory_limit=128M
      upload_max_filesize=2M
      post_max_size=8M
      max_execution_time=30
      max_input_time=60

#   Change to (suggestion)
      memory_limit=256M
      upload_max_filesize=256M
      post_max_size=256M
      max_execution_time=240
      max_input_time=240

#   reload the new parameters
sudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm.service (depends of your installation)

#   And then you can upload files up to 200 Mb
